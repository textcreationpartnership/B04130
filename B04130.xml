            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which how truly it is verified in our days, every body knows, that knows but his right hand from his left, and the stones in the street will shortly cry out shame of, if men hold their peace.</p>
            <p>But the present Instance may spare the trouble of a further preamble, our Theme it self being enough alone to satisfie the world of its own depravity.</p>
            <p>In the Neighbourhood of <hi>London</hi> there dwelled a poor man, with his Wife and three small Children, that lived in part of a pitiful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180266:3"/> house belonging to a certain person, whose name I shall here forbear to mention, till the Law has more fully decided his Offence; yet he is one notorious enough amongst his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>These poor people having such a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and being very mean in the world, happened to fall so short of money that they could not pay him their last Quarters Rent due at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> being (as the Neighbours affirm) not above five shillings, the Room going at twenty shillings a year, and dear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in conscience, considering what it was; whereupon not knowing what to do, and partly sensible of their Landlords severity wherever he had an advantage, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band fearing an Arrest, thought it his best course to get out of the way; and so left his Wife and Children in possession till he could pick up abroad the aforesaid sum to satisfie the Rent.</p>
            <p>In his absence his Wife was deplorably poor, having three mouths to feed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for besides her own; but all that could, it seems, work no pity or compassion in her Landlord's breast, he was resolved to have his Rent, even in the spight of that old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Where nothing is to be had</hi>—And to this purpose he came upon <hi>Friday</hi> last being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180266:4"/> the 13th of this Instant <hi>November,</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, and seized on all those pitiful move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables she had, and turned her three Babes out of doors, to seek their Lodging in the op<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n street.</p>
            <p>But this was not all; for as if he had thought to get that satisfaction out of her poor Carcass, which he could not find in her Goods and Chattels, upon some hasty words, or small provocation, he fell upon her, and most manfully beat her, giving her several la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable blows, kicks and spurns, especially about the breast and belly, so that she cried out most miserably at the very instant that he had spoil'd her. However she continued alive two or three days after, but was forced to lie with her Children in a cold pitiful Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or Dog-kennel, and was all that time in a sad case, not able scarce to go or stand: And so languishing every hour worse than other, she at last died, complaining to the last of her Landlords Cruelty, and taking it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her death that his Beating of her was the occasion of it; which seem'd the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, when the women going to lay the Corps forth, found a great part of her belly black and blue with the bruises and batteries she had received.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Coroner was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180266:4"/> with the Accident, and the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Landlo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
